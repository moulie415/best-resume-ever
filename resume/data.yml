about: Outside of work you'll find me working on my own coding projects, playing guitar (inside and outside church), going to the gym or browsing the internet for cute dogs. My main side projects in 2020 involved helping an overseas missionary couple to develop a number of apps. These included a Bible verse a day app called Awal i Wass (Word of God for Each Day) spoken in a language called Tashelhiyt. This app is available on Google Play and the App Store, and code for all the projects can be found at https://github.com/rd113267. I am currently working with a Personal Trainer and Osteopath who commissioned me to develop an app called Christian Antonee Health. This app is yet to be released but the code can be found at https://github.com/moulie415/ChristianAntoneeHealth.
