about: Outside of work you'll find me working on my own coding projects, playing guitar (inside and outside church), going to the gym or browsing the internet for cute dogs. My main side projects in 2020 involved helping an overseas missionary develop a number of apps including a Bible verse of the day app called awal i wass (which roughly translates to word of God for each day) spoken in a language called Tashelhiyt. This app can be found on Google Play and the App Store and code for all the projects can be found here https://github.com/rd113267. My main side project at the moment involves working alongside and Personal trainer and osteopath to help develop an app called Health and Movement which is yet to be released but the code for which can be found here https://github.com/moulie415/HealthAndMovement.
